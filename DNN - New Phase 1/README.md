# DNN - The New Phase 1

The purpose of this Neural Network was to run a sentiment analysis classifier; Taking the [Kaggle Movie Database](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/data) in conjunction with Google's [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/). 

Keras was used to setup, train, and test the network. The network architecture can be found in the trainCNN.py file.
